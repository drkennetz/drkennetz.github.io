# About Me

Hi all, my name is Dennis Kennetz and I want to thank you for visiting my site. I am a follower of Jesus, a grateful husband and father, a developer by profession, and an enthusiastic (albeit slow) runner by hobby. I began this blog because I like writing. I find it to be cathartic to share my experience. I hope you enjoy my content, and learn a thing or two along the way.
