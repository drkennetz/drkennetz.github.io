<p>Thanks for stopping by my site, where I talk about life and software engineering.
This can range from things I've seen on the job, to new tech I find interesting.
If you'd like to read about my journey into engineering, check out this <a href="/blog/journeyintodevelopment/">post</a>.

As a footnote, I am no good at making this beautiful. If you are, and would like to contribute to an open-source blog,
feel free to stop by <a href="https://github.com/drkennetz/drkennetz.github.io">this blog's repo</a> and post an issue!
I welcome the help and the collaboration.
</p>
